Introduction:
Welcome to my little world! You can try to look around my world and interact with my cute tree! Oh, you can also see beautiful sunrise and sunset in my world! A day lasts around 30 seconds (at least it is the case for my computer).

Manipulation:
	// Move your mouse to control your view (You can try to look at your back and please try it ;w;)
	// Let the starting direction be the north (and actually you can see the sun rises in the east)
	// Press "W" to move the tree to the north
	// Press "A" to move the tree to the west
	// Press "S" to move the tree to the south
	// Press "D" to move the tree to the east
	// Remark: You can't move the tree to the outside of the world!
	// Press "Q" to enlarge the tree
	// Press "E" to reduce the tree (The tree is initially of its minimum size)
        // Press "Esc" to exit
